						<p>CLASS NOTES


poShape2D derives directly from poObject and is the parent class of all 2D graphics objects

in potionCode, including poRectShape, poOvalShape and poLineShape (see "poShapeBasics2D.h").


All poShape2D objects and poShape2D subclasses:


+ Have all the properties and methods of poObject.

+ Have a list of "points" that form the contour of the shape.

+ Have fillColor and strokeColor properties

+ Have fillEnabled and strokeEnabled properties.

+ Have a fillDrawStyle property that determines how OpenGL uses the points (GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, GL_POLYGON, etc)

+ Have a generateStroke method for generating a high-quality thick stroke with multiple capping options.

+ Have a placeTexture and and transformTexture methods for assigning a poTexture to the shape

+ Have a pointInside method for testing if a point is inside the shape.

						<p>DRAWING

The draw() method is called automatically if a shape is added to the scene graph.

You should not need to call the draw() method yourself.

						<p>SHAPE POINTS

poShape2D maintains a list of points that define the contour the shape.

Points can be added one by one, or can be added as vector of points.

The "curveTo" method generates a curve formed by adding many points.

						<p>SHAPE TEXTURE

A poShape2D can be assigned a poTexture.

By default, the texture will be placed within the shape at actual size. This means that

the texture image may extend beyond the bounds of the shape or may not be large enough

to fill the shape. Use the poTextureFitOption's to determine how a texture is placed

into the shape. These poTextureFitOption's are listed in poEnums.h. Once a texture is placed,

you can use transform the placement, rotation and scale of the texture.

					<div class="code">
						<pre>poShape2D&amp;              placeTexture(poTexture *tex);
poShape2D&amp;              placeTexture(poTexture *tex, poTextureFitOption fit);
poShape2D&amp;              placeTexture(poTexture *tex, poTextureFitOption fit, poAlignment align);

						<p>HIGH QUALITY SHAPE STROKE

By default, poShape2D's use a simple OpenGL stroke. Unfortunately, when the stroke width

is greater than 3 pixels, the OpenGL stroke appear broken at every corner. As a solution,

poShape2D includes a "generateStroke" method that creates a very high quality stroke.

This stroke is actually drawn as a very thin filled shape. These high quality strokes

scale with the shape, unlike simple strokes which do not scale.

						<pre>poShape2D&amp;              generateStroke(int strokeWidth, poStrokePlacementProperty place=PO_STROKE_PLACE_CENTER, poStrokeJoinProperty join=PO_STROKE_JOIN_MITRE, poStrokeCapProperty cap=PO_STROKE_CAP_BUTT);

						<p>POINT INSIDE

pointInside assumes points are in window-native coordinates (0,0 is in the upper left).

The localize option will convert the point from global to local coordinates before

performing the test.
